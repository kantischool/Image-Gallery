# ImageGallery-Compose
- This is the image gallery app.
- I buildt this app using Flickr Image API.
- There is 2 page in navigation drawer, 1) Home 2)Search Image
- In home page recently added image comes from api.
- I used pagination to load more images. (Paging 3 Library).
- In "Search Image" page you can search images of your choice. and it fetch related images from api.
- To manage code base i used MVVM architecture.
- I also used dependency injection (Hilt / Dagger).
- Coroutine are also used for background related task.
- For API call i have used Retrofit2 library.
- For image loading i have used Glide library.
